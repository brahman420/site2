                        Squirtle is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

                        Squirtle is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has a blue body with purple eyes, a light brown
                        belly,
                        and a tough red-brown shell on its back. It has a long tail that curls into a spiral.

                        Squirtle is primarily based on a turtle, taking inspiration from both land-dwelling and
                        sea-dwelling
                        varieties. The curly tail resembles a crashing wave

                        Wartortle is a small, bipedal, turtle-like Pokémon with a similar appearance to that of its
                        pre-evolved form, Squirtle.


                        Some differences are that Wartortle have developed sharper and larger
                        claws and teeth, and that their tails are larger and fluffier than those of Squirtle's. The fur
                        on
                        Wartortle's tail darkens with age. Wartortle have developed large furry ears. Like its
                        pre-evolved
                        form, it can also use its shell to protect itself. Its shell bears the scratches of many
                        battles.

                        Blastoise is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

                        Blastoise is a large, bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has a blue body with small purple eyes, a
                        light brown belly, and a stubby tail. It has a large brown shell with two powerful water cannons
                        on either side, which can be withdrawn.

                        Blastoise's design is heavily influenced by turtles and tortoises. The cannons likely draw
                        inspiration from the concept of a mobile tank or battleship.

                        Blastoise is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original starter Pokémon,
                        along with Venusaur and Charizard. It has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and
                        Pokémon Go; it also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive
                        G-Max move, G-Max Cannonade.
